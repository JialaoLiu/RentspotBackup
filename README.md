# 2. RentSpot - Property Rental Platform

## 2.1 Project Description

RentSpot is a web-based property rental application developed for COMP SCI 2207/7207 Web & Database Computing. The platform connects property seekers with landlords, allowing users to search for rental properties, book inspections, and manage property listings across Australia.

This project demonstrates full-stack web development using modern technologies including Vue.js (with Vue CLI), Node.js, and MySQL, with integration of third-party APIs for enhanced functionality.

**Note**: This project uses Vue CLI instead of Vite to comply with course requirements. All environment variables use the `VUE_APP_` prefix.

## 2.2 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- MySQL (v8.0 or higher) - *Not required for Codespaces*
- Git
- Modern web browser

### GitHub Codespaces Setup
**Fully Automatic Setup** - No manual configuration required!

When you create a new Codespace, everything will be automatically configured:
- MySQL database installation and setup
- Database schema import with sample data
- Backend dependencies installation
- Frontend dependencies installation
- Environment files creation
- API URL configuration for Codespaces

### Important: Database Not Showing Up Immediately?

If you do not see the database content correctly mapped to the backend or displayed on the frontend:

1. Run the setup script manually:
```bash
bash setup.sh
2.	Note that GitHub Codespaces can sometimes take up to 2 minutes to fully initialize MySQL.
3.	After waiting, restart both the backend and frontend:
```bash
cd backend&&npm start
```bash
cd rentspot-frontend&&npm run serve

This is not a bug — just a Codespaces delay. Apologies for any confusion; I spent significant time debugging this issue alone to ensure the system now recovers correctly with the above steps.

Simply create a Codespace and wait for the setup to complete, then start the application.

### 1. Database Setup

#### For Local Development:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE Rent_database;
USE Rent_database;
SOURCE backend/Rent_database_updated.sql;
```

#### For GitHub Codespaces:
**No setup required** - Database is automatically configured during Codespace creation.

### 2. Backend Configuration

#### For Local Development:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=Ljl12345!  # Your MySQL password
DB_NAME=Rent_database
DB_PORT=3306

JWT_SECRET=00ae84691b5cc7bb6ca21e11779bc0cefb5ed62d1b7331a71ea0628e7f2c98d54331b54f3c67084bc2ec0e78e9ef21473b9b575eb7e8336dc5faebdafb44dacf

PORT=8080

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzxrmtus9
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=138993529279886
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=23CK6Atf0I_PolCywakizy-PJU8

TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=0x4AAAAAABdkinnD2a45uxc0
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=0x4AAAAAABdkii48VRRJP3Cb8Ggbml6zNyQ

NEWS_API_KEY=d9b129de2e5e432e8315073b3e294fc3

API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
NODE_ENV=development
```

Create `.env` file in the frontend directory (`rentspot-frontend/.env`):
```env
VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
VUE_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzxrmtus9
VUE_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=rentspot_unsigned
VUE_APP_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=0x4AAAAAABdkinnD2a45uxc0
VUE_APP_TURNSTILE_TEST_SITE_KEY=1x00000000000000000000AA
```

#### For GitHub Codespaces:
**No setup required** - All configuration files are automatically created during Codespace setup.

### 3. Start the Application

#### For Local Development:
Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
Backend runs at: `http://localhost:8080`

Start the frontend server:
```bash
cd rentspot-frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```
Frontend runs at: `http://localhost:5173`

#### For GitHub Codespaces:
After the automatic setup completes, simply run:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd rentspot-frontend && npm run serve
```
The application will be accessible via the forwarded ports (8080 for API, 5173 for frontend).

### 4. Test Accounts

Pre-configured test accounts (password: `11111111` for all):

## 2.7 Known Issues

### Current Bugs
1. **Map View Marker Overlap**: When properties have the same location, map markers overlap and only one property can be viewed
2. **Dark Mode Mobile Toggle**: On mobile devices, the dark mode toggle requires two taps to switch themes
3. **Edit Property Images**: Cannot view existing uploaded image URLs in the property edit modal
4. **Cloudflare Turnstile Limitation**: CAPTCHA functionality unavailable in Codespaces due to API domain restrictions

### UI/UX Issues
5. **Toast Notification Positioning**: Toast messages appear over the navbar, affecting user experience
6. **Toast Notification Styling**: Notifications display in black/white instead of red due to dark mode global styles conflicts
7. **Search Filter Persistence**: Filter selections reset when navigating between pages due to different developers working on separate interfaces

The application includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback through toast notifications.

### 2.13 Technical References & Documentation

This section lists the main technologies, tools, and frameworks we used to build RentSpot, along with the key docs and tutorials that helped guide our development. We tried to keep track of useful links as we coded, but we probably missed a few—especially after closing too many tabs once the feature was working and thought, "finally done" (which, to be honest, happened more than once).

Throughout the project, we learned a lot from official docs, blog posts, guides, and example projects. That said, every feature was hand-built based on our own research and understanding—not just copied from a single source.

We’re sharing this list both to give credit where it’s due, and to help ourselves if we ever need to revisit, update, or build another project in the future. But after the course ends, some of the external APIs used during development may be disabled to prevent potential data leaks or unauthorized access.

# 3. RentSpot AU - Git Branch Usage Guide

To ensure clean collaboration, **each team member must work on their own branch**.
**Never commit directly to the `main` branch.** All changes must go through pull requests (PRs).

## Assigned Development Branches

Current dev branches for each member:

- Jialao: dev/jialao
- Nhat Tan: dev/nhattan
- Deze: dev/deze

## Step 1: Create Your Branch (One-time setup)

Start from the latest `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout -b dev/yourname
git push -u origin dev/yourname
```

Replace `yourname` with your actual name or alias.

## Step 2: Keep Your Branch Updated with `main`

Before you start working, always sync with the latest `main` to avoid conflicts:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout dev/yourname
git rebase main        # or: git merge main
```

If conflicts occur, fix them, then:

```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

Then push your updated branch:

```bash
git push -f     # Use force push only after rebase
```

## Step 3: Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add login page"
git push
```

## Step 4: Submit a Pull Request (PR)

After finishing your task:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill in PR title and description (e.g., what changed, what was tested)
4. Submit PR → team lead will review and merge

## Step 5: How to Sync main into Your Branch When Behind

If your branch shows something like "33 commits behind main":

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Switch to your branch (e.g., dev/jialao)
3. Click "Compare & pull request" (if available) to merge main into your branch

Or use terminal commands:
```bash
git checkout dev/yourname
git pull origin main
git push origin dev/yourname
```

## Notes

- Never commit or push directly to `main`
- Always work in your own branch (e.g., `dev/yournanme`)
- Sync with `main` regularly using rebase or merge
- All changes must go through a PR

If your branch shows **"nothing to compare"** when opening a PR, it means your branch was not created from the latest `main`. Please recreate your branch correctly or contact Jialao for help.

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Software
- Node.js (v16+)
- Visual Studio Code
- Git

### Project Setup

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the local development server
```bash
npm run serve
```
The project will automatically run at:
http://localhost:5173/

If you want to allow other devices on your local network to access it, the host is already enabled by default.

## Code Standards

### JavaScript Code Style Guide (.js files)

To ensure code consistency (and avoid errors during school computer demonstrations), please follow these JavaScript coding standards:

#### Basic Rules

- **Semicolons**
  Always add a semicolon (;) at the end of each statement to avoid potential issues caused by Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).
